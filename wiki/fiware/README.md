ScorpioBroker is a NGSI-LD context broker that is incorporated into PDT. The NGSI-LD API enables the management, access and discovery of context information. Context information consists of entities (e.g. a building) and their properties (e.g. address and geographic location) and relationships (e.g. owner). 
Thus Scorpio enables applications and services to request context information â€“ what they need, when they need it and how they need it.
Through Scorpio users can manipulate and query context information, subscribe to changes and receive notifications when they happen.
