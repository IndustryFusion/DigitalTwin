# Knowledge, Models, Shapes (KMS)

The default knowledge base of the platform: `knowledge.ttl` (ontology facts),
`shacl.ttl` (constraints and SPARQL rules), and `model-instance.jsonld`
(example entities; `model-instance.scorpio.jsonld` is the variant with one
attribute instance per datasetId that Scorpio's batch upsert accepts).

## Conventions

### Timestamps

Every timestamp carried as a **property value** uses ISO 8601 UTC with
millisecond precision and the `Z` suffix:

```
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ        e.g. 2024-02-27T13:54:55.400Z
```

This is the same representation NGSI-LD prescribes for `observedAt`, so one
format flows from model to TSDB to writeback. The form is fixed-width, which
makes lexical order equal chronological order — SPARQL rules may compare two
timestamps directly (`FILTER(?ts1 > ?ts2)`), and `xsd:dateTime(?v)`
normalizes a value into this canonical form for such comparisons. Rules that
copy an attribute's `ngsild:observedAt` into a property value emit this form
as well.

Do not write epoch numbers into time-valued properties: they are ambiguous
(seconds vs milliseconds), untyped, and the two SQL dialects the pipeline
compiles to do not even share an epoch for their internal conversions.
Millisecond arithmetic remains available inside rule expressions — arithmetic
on time variables converts to milliseconds automatically.
