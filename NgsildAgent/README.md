# IFF IoT Agent


The agent sends metrics data to the IFF-PDT.

## Utils
The utils directory contains bash scripts to setup and activate a device.
### init-device.sh
This script is setting up the default device-file and metadata.
```bash
Usage: init-device.sh <deviceId> <gatewayId> [-k keycloakurl] [-r realmId]
Defaults: 
keycloakurl=http://keycloak.local/auth/realms/iff
realmid=iff
```
Example:
```bash
./init-device.sh urn:iff:deviceid:1 gatewayid
```
Note that `deviceid` must be compliant wiht URN format.
### get-onbaording-token.sh
This script assumes a setup device-file, creates an onboarding token and stores it in the data directory.
```bash
Usage: get-onbaording-token.sh [-p password] [-s secret-file-name] <username>
-p provide password through commandline. If missing, password will requested interactively
-s if set, it puts the token into a k8s secret with name 'secret-file-name' otherwise it will be dumped to file ../data/onboard-token.json.
```
example
```
Usage: ./get-onbaording-token.sh -p LhCU0Jd9zwoHD40izcf6s10hdLUiOuqQ realm_user
```
The secret of the realm_user can be retrieve from K8s by using:
```bash
kubectl -n iff get secret/credential-iff-realm-user-iff -o jsonpath='{.data.password}'| base64 -d | xargs echo
```

### activate.sh
This script assumes a setup device-file and a onboarding-token either dumped to file or a kubernetes secret. I takes an obaording secret an created a device token which is stored in the `data` directory
```bash
Usage: activate.sh [-s] [-f]
```
Example:
```bash
./activate.sh -f
```

### send-data.sh
This script sends data to a device. It uses the UDP API (see below) to communicate to the Agent.
```bash
Usage: send_data.sh <propertyname> <value>
```
Node that it can only be used to send Properties. Relationships must be changed with NGSI-LD API or using the UDP API directly as shown below.

### Use tools alltogether to activate a device
On a test system with a local kubernetes installed the following flow creates a default test device

```bash
./init-device.sh urn:iff:deviceid:1 gatewayid
password=$(kubectl -n iff get secret/credential-iff-realm-user-iff -o jsonpath='{.data.password}'| base64 -d)
./get-onbaording-token.sh -p ${password} realm_user
./activate.sh -f
./send_data.sh "https://example.com/state" "ON"
```

### iff-agent
This is a "agent" program intended to run as a service. You can send a very simple NGSI-LD component message, such as
```
{"n": "<uri>", "v": 26.9, "t": "Property"}
{"n": "<uri>", "v": "<urn>, "t": "Relationship"}
```
or an array like this
```
[{"n": "<uri>", "v": 26.9, "on": 1618325707931, "t": "Property"},{"n": "<url>", "v": 27.2, "on": 1618325787105, "t": "Property}]
```
to a UDP socket on port 41234 or TCP socket on port 7070. The agent will handle secure communication with the upstream IFF instance.
Note that the `<uri>` is the fully expanded JSON-LD field name of the property or relationship. E.g. The NGSI-LD object looks like

```json
{
  "id": "urn:iff:deviceid:1",
  "type": "type",
  "http://example.com/state": "state" 
}

```
then the state can be updated by
```json
{"n": "http://example.com/state", "v": "ON", "t": "Property"}
```
Note that the `t` paramter can be left out. In this case the default value for `t` is `Property`. 

## Installing
``` bash
npm install
```

#### Configuration
Before using the agent you need to configure it so it knows how to communicate with your OISP instance. The agent looks for the configuration file 'config.json' in the 'config' directory. A template is provided in the 'config' directory which you can copy and modify using your favourite text editor.

``` bash
cp config/config.json.template config/config.json
```

#### Starting the Agent

To start the oisp-agent service simply execute the start script:
``` bash
./iff-agent.js
```


### Configure SparkPlugB Standard 

1. To enable SparkplugB standard data format, you need to update the agent config as below:

``` bash
 "mqtt": {
              "host": "emqx",
              "port": 1883,
              "qos": 1,
              "retain": false,
              "secure": false,
              "strictSSL": false,
              "retries": 5,
              "sparkplugB": true, 
              "version": "spBv1.0"            
          }
```
 - "SparkplugB":true -> enables the sparkplugB feature of agent
 - "version": "spBv1.0", -> version of spB standard, default is spBv1.0
 
 2.  CID is used as alias, as sparkplugB standard suggest unique id as alias in data metric element.
   Data message looks like below:

``` bash
    var cid = "0c574252-31d5-4b76-bce6-53f2c56b544d";
    var DataMessage = {
            timestamp: 12345,
            metrics: [{
                name : "temp",
                alias : cid,
                timestamp : 12345,
                dataType : "float",
                value: 123
            }],
            seq: 1
         };
```

3. Sending NGSI-LD compatible data over Mqtt-SparkplugB
- Register devices for custom Relationship and Property catalog
- Use device name for Relationship as " Name : Relationship/Name_of_device",

    Datatype is iri (String):

    Eg. Name: "Relationship/https://industry-fusion.com/types/v0.9/hasFilter"

- Use device name format for Property as " Name: Property/Name_of_device"

  Datatype can be literals(string, integer,boolean) and iri(string)

  Eg. Name: "Property/https://industry-fusion.com/types/v0.9/state"

## Onboarding

The onboarding is designed to work with the direct OIDC API from Keycloak. The `direct_grant` flow is used to generate an `offline` session. Every session is assigned to a single device

### Onbarding Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
autonumber
   Actor Admin;
   Participant Keycloak;
   Participant Device;
   Participant MQTT;
   Admin ->> Keycloak: Request Onboarding Token
   Keycloak ->> Admin: Return Onboarding Token
   Admin ->> Device: Provide Onboarding Token
   Device ->> Keycloak: Activate by Refreshing with refresh_token, providing the old access token in the "orig_token" form-data-fiel and providing device id in HTTP Headers ('X-DeviceId' and 'X-GatewayId')
   Keycloak ->> Device: Provide Device Token and Refreshed Token with "device_id" and "gateway" as claim
   Device ->> MQTT: checks "device_id" claim in token and compares it with mqtt topics

```
There are two kinds of tokens:
1. Onboarding Token - A token which is not yet assigned to a specific device and can be used to onboard any device.
2. Device Token - A token which has assigned a specific device and can be refreshed with a `refresh token`. A Device Token is generated by refreshing an Onboarding Token, adding the old `access_token` to the `orig_token` form-field and set in this request the headers `X-DeviceId` and `X-GatewayId`
